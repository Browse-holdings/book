## 24. Habari

By three years in, the project included developers, support forum volunteers, documentarians, and other people interested in helping out. Many had been around since the early days, and while the project and software had grown and changed, some felt that the governance structure had not. A free software project can be run in many different ways. WordPress has always had a Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) structure, meaning that the final decision often rests with the BDFL -- Matt. In practice, it was often Ryan Boren who made and implemented most of the technical decisions. However, some contributors felt that the project could benefit from a committee structure, with a team of people driving the project’s direction and decision making. There was a difference of opinion in how a free software project should run. Some were unhappy with how Matt lead the project, and [left](http://skippy.net/wordpress-less). It was in this context that the first major fork of WordPress happened -- though it wasn’t a fork of the software, but a fork of the community.

The unhappy contributors happened to come together in September 2006, at the Ohio Linux Fest in Columbus. They had lunch together at a Buca di Beppo. Among the diners were four WordPress developers -- Owen Winkler ([ringmaster](http://profiles.wordpress.org/ringmaster)), Rich Bowen ([drbacchus](http://profiles.wordpress.org/drbacchus)), Scott Merrill ([Skippy](http://profiles.wordpress.org/skippy)), and Chris Davis ([chrisjdavis](http://profiles.wordpress.org/chrisjdavis)). During lunch they talked about their project grievances. The same story came up again and again -- patches were rejected because they didn’t fit the project's vision. Conversation kept returning to the possibility of setting up a new free and open source (FOSS) project. By the time the meal ended, the four WordPress developers had decided [to stop talking and act](http://matsu.wordpress.com/2007/01/08/witnessing-the-birth-of-an-open-source-project-habari/); they would create a new blogging tool. A few weeks later at ApacheCon, they chose a name: Habari, which is a Swahili word for "What's up?" or "What's the news?" At the same gathering, they created a governance structure and development ethos for the project, and started work in earnest.

Habari launched in January 2007, and many of Habari's founding philosophies are in direct opposition to those of the WordPress project. The [Habari Motivations](https://web.archive.org/web/20070111191036/http://code.google.com/p/habari/wiki/Motivations) page lists the reasons for being involved with Habari. Each of the motivations addresses something that the founding developers believed was wrong within the WordPress project -- things that they wanted to do differently. They reflect the different approaches to running a free software project, and also highlight some problems afoot in the WordPress project three years after its launch. Every free software project -- indeed every group or community -- has its problems, especially an established community. Differences that may have been ignored during the initial heat of enthusiasm become entrenched, and as enthusiasm fades, those differences surface.

Governance style was one major issue. Many weren’t happy with the BDFL model. A BDFL governance model is common in free software projects. Notable BDFLs are Linus Torvalds of Linux and Guido van Rossum of Python. A BDFL is a free software project leader -- the one person who has final say about the project's direction and vision. In reality, as a project grows there are often many influential people who make decisions about project direction. 

Rich Bowen, one of the developers who was dissatisfied with how WordPress was run, came from the Apache project. Apache has a committee model. The committee comprises developers and non-developers, all of whom have a say in how the project runs. Unlike WordPress, which requires that commits be approved by the committer and/or the patch reviewer, commits in Apache require consensus. Habari launched with a committee structure, much like Apache. Decisions are made by committee consensus.

[Designer Michael Heilemann](http://web.archive.org/web/20070117005952/http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2007/01/07/time-to-habari/) was one person enticed by Habari. He’d designed the Kubrick theme and was looking for a new challenge after the Shuttle project failed before implementation. 

Michael redesigned the Habari interface -- which he says now was both a good and a bad experience. [He had a good experience designing and implementing it](http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_11_06_Heilemann.html#L84). He had a bad experience getting it approved, because of Habari's committee structure. A lot of time was spent discussing and approving the new admin interface. People with no design background weighed in with opinions and everyone received equal weight. This left Michael feeling like he couldn't get his work done and he ended up leaving Habari. When asked about whether he prefers a BDFL or Apache-style model, [he says now](http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_11_06_Heilemann.html#L88): 

> It’s easy to end up in very long discussions if everybody has equal footing. And that makes for a great democracy, but it’s also very hippie, 60s, everybody gets to sit around and share their opinion, but that’s not always something that’s really worthwhile. You don’t actually, necessarily, get a better product out of it. And so often you need somebody with vision, or at least somebody with a point of view with opinion to weigh in.

Commit access was another flashpoint. In the Apache project, a clear path to commit access to the repository existed. In WordPress in early 2006, getting commit access was not possible for most people. Only Matt and Ryan had commit access to WordPress; they acted as a funnel through which all code would be reviewed. More committers were eventually added, but it was a slow process and one that led to frustration, particularly among prolific contributors. 

Coming from Apache, Rich brought a different perspective to the project -- one that chimed with the more dissatisfied developers. For Rich, [WordPress didn’t constitute a true meritocracy](ttps://neosmart.net/blog/2007/a-clarification-on-wordpress/comment-page-1/#comment-10985) -- there was no opportunity for those with ability to gain power and responsibility. The final decision over who did and didn’t get power and authority lay with the project’s leader -- it was up to Matt's discretion to determine who had ability and deserved power. When Matt, in a discussion thread, said that WordPress is a meritocracy because commit access is provided to "the best of the best of the best contributors who prove their worth over time with high quality code, responsiveness to the community, and reliability in crunch times,” Rich responded by pointing out that because the final decision lies with the BDFL it prevents the community from becoming a true meritocracy.

What lay at the heart of the discussion was a fundamental disagreement about how a free software project should be structured.  In _Homesteading the Noosphere_ Eric Raymond discusses [project structures and ownership](http://catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/ar01s16.html), looking at how a project structure emerges over time. The emergence of WordPress' project structure very much follows what Raymond outlines; the project has a single owner/maintainer, or in the case of WordPress it had two -- Mike Little and Matt Mullenweg. Over time, Matt assumed project leadership. In WordPress' case, commit access carried with it an implicit level of authority. Those with commit access are the arbiters of the code that ends up in core. Matt [made clear on a number of occasions](http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/June/June29RawLog) that he didn't "want it to be a status thing," but this didn't prevent it from becoming so.

Matt posted to the [mailing list in 2005 saying](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-June/001417.html) "Committing != community status. It simply is a way to ensure that all the code that goes into the core is reviewed before being distributed to the world.” But community members naturally ascribe authority to those with commit access. People with commit access are trusted above others. It was unclear what it took to become a committer or a lead developer. Instead, the roles developed organically. For the community, authority naturally followed commit access to the repository, and commit access followed high quality code submissions along with an understanding and commitment to the project ethos. Commit is a symbol of trust; with only two committers it appeared that the project leads did not trust others in the community. 

This had another consequence: a lack of acknowledgement for non-code contributions. Because implied authority naturally followed code it meant that there were no defined leadership roles within the project for non-coders. Commit access may have been given out sparingly to developers but authority and leadership was still in theory achievable to anyone who could write code. For those whose role was in the support forums, writing documentation, providing translations, or any of the myriad supporting activities that go on around software development, there was no formal way for those who worked hard and demonstrated a commitment to the project to progress, gain status, or be acknowledged. While coders receive props for code accepted into core, there was no system of acknowledgement for those who worked on supporting activities. So when there were rumblings of discontent, it wasn’t just coders who were complaining. 

Habari’s approach was the opposite of WordPress. Commit access was achievable by anyone. The [Habari motivations page says](https://web.archive.org/web/20070111191036/http://code.google.com/p/habari/wiki/Motivations) "Our contribution model is a meritocracy. If you contribute code regularly, you will be granted permission to make contributions directly (commit access).” The project takes this approach even further -- it isn’t just coders who received commit access. Owen Winkler, one of Habari’s founders, [says](http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_08_20_Winkler.html#L103):

> There are some people who are committers, who are part of the primary management committee in Habari who I would never want to actually touch the code because they don’t really do development. But we give them access to it because they’ve demonstrated that they’re part of the community and they’re actively trying to advance Habari as a project.

In Habari, commit access is a clear sign of trust and responsibility in the project. In a project in which commit access equals responsibility and authority, it makes sense to give access to anyone who holds such a position within the project. However, if you're trying to create a project in which the two do not go hand-in-hand, keeping commit access as purely a checking mechanism makes sense. That said, if it’s not clear to people within the project what constitutes authority and what doesn't, then commit access is one of the few indicators of authority.

WordPress' focus has always been on users, and maintaining a good experience for them. Habari, on the other hand, was intended to be useful to users, but at its heart it is an educational tool for developers. One of the driving ideas behind Habari was to create a tool that taught people about development, development best practices, and being part of a free software project. Rich Bowen, who did't know a lot of PHP, said that he hoped that the new project would teach him about it. This meant not just teaching developers about PHP, but educating them about best practices around coding methods and being part of a FOSS community. They eschewed WordPress' low barrier to entry in favor of an approach that would cultivate fewer but stronger developers. 

Habari was written in PHP 5.1, giving developers access to [PHP Data Objects](http://php.net/manual/en/intro.pdo.php). This gave Habari a level of database independence lacking in WordPress. On one hand, Habari developers found fault with WordPress for not using the latest coding practices, on the other, WordPress developers felt that the Habari approach put users second. As [Ryan Boren put it](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-February/010881.html):

> Screwing users because developers want to play is not cool. It’s a good way to become irrelevant. A big reason WP is so popular is because it is not infatuated with the latest, greatest developer lust objects that require users to upgrade their platform.

In February 2007, when Ryan wrote that comment, PHP 4 was still running on 88.44% of websites. PHP 5 adoption was slow and many web hosts didn't support it. If WordPress had made the switch to PHP 5 it would have meant that it was suddenly unavailable on a huge number of hosts -- breaking users' sites around the world.

Habari's license choice also signifies fundamental differences in FOSS beliefs. WordPress has a GPL license, which is intended to secure the freedoms of users. Habari, on the other hand, uses the [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). This permissive license allows developers to take the code and use it in any way -- even in a proprietary product. In the Apache license, the emphasis is very much on developer freedom. [Owen Winkler outlined the reasons](http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_08_20_Winkler.html#L81) why the Habari project chose not to use a GPL license:

> There's the idea of developer freedom. If you give the software away you should be able to give it away with no requirements at all. If you want to take it and make software that you sell, then go ahead and do that. Hopefully you won’t. Hopefully you’ll contribute. Or if do, you’ll contribute what you make back to the community somehow.

All of these differences were, in the end, unresolvable, despite the fact that things were starting to change. Change was slow and the developers became more and more disenfranchised, but change was happening. Mark Jaquith, who was given commit access while the other developers were quietly working on Habari, [recalls](http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_09_12_Jaquith.html#L73) "I felt like […] Matt was right on the verge of loosening the reins, it felt like things were really starting to get good and they left. And I was like oh, if you’d just held on." 

But they didn’t hold on. By the time the reins loosened they had founded their own project with their own ideals and focus. FOSS communities can be run in many different ways. Sometimes the emphasis is on free software, sometimes open source. Sometimes the emphasis is on users, sometimes developers. Sometimes the license is permissive, sometimes copyleft. The wider free software communities are broad and encompass people from different backgrounds. Each project has its own set of ideals and cultural norms, and sometimes project members gel with those ideals and sometimes they don’t. When there is a critical mass of people within that project who don’t accept a project’s core ideals then there is always the possibility of creating a fork. This can be a fork of the software or, as was the case with Habari, a fork of the community. This is not, necessarily, a [Bad Thing](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/F/forked.html). Rather than struggling with constant debates and infighting that comes from a clash of beliefs, sometimes it is better for two groups to separate. Then there are two projects, each with a laser-sharp focus on the things that matter to them and on the software and project that they want to create.
