## 41. The Community Summit

2012 saw the first en-masse invitation-only WordPress community get-together: The Community Summit. Up until then, contributors got together at WordCamps, and the core team had smaller, focused meetups, but there had never been a large community event focused on issues that face WordPress software development and the wider WordPress community. Community members could nominate themselves and others to receive an invite; a team of 18 people reviewed and voted on who would be invited. The attendees -- active contributors, bloggers, plugin and theme developers, and business owners from across the WordPress community -- came to Tybee Island, Georgia, to talk about WordPress.

The main event, held at Tybee wedding chapel, was a one-day unconference. A few informal days for working on projects were scheduled afterward. In the morning, attendees pitched suggestions for discussion, discussion groups formed around tables, and twice during the day individual groups shared their proposals for taking action. 

The subjects discussed were broad, covering the spectrum of development and community issues. Development-specific topics discussed included mobile apps, improving deployments, using WordPress as a framework, multisite, JavaScript, the theme customizer, and automatic updates. There were also discussions about how to increase developer experience including better information for developers on UI practices. Broader community discussions were focused on the role of the WordPress Foundation, open sourcing WordCamp.org, the GPL, and women in the WordPress community. There were discussions about different WordPress.org teams such as UI, accessibility, theme review, and discussions about improving documentation. The summit attendees included people from all over the world and attendees talked about internationalization and global communities. Business owners raised issues such as managed WordPress hosts and quality control in commercial plugins. And, finally, there were discussions about making it easier for both individuals and businesses to contribute to the project.

With so much discussion, and many different ideas raised, some proposed ideas moved forward, while others were dropped without sufficient contributor support. Concrete changes that came about from the discussions at the summit include:

- Better theme review process documentation to increase consistency and transparency.
- A documentation and Codex roadmap. (developer.wordpress.org eventually launched.)
- Language packs included in core in WordPress 4.0.
- Headers added to the P2 themes to tell contributors what to do to get involved in that area.
- Published a make/events sub-team list.
- Automatic updates for core. 
- Individual plugin reviews on WordPress.org.
- Open sourced the WordCamp.org base theme.

As well as creating a space for contributors to discuss issues, many contributors met for the first time at the summit, and the in-person meeting helped to invigorate the community. 

It was around this time that a new team formed: a review team for the plugin repository. Up until that time, much of the work on the plugin repository was done by Mark Riley, who was responsible for reviewing plugins. The community felt that plugins should be subject to the same rigor as themes. The question of plugin review was posed on both [community blogs](http://wptavern.com/is-a-plugin-validation-team-a-pipe-dream) and on [wp-hackers](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-August/034146.html). The number of plugins had grown rapidly and some people had concerns about code quality.	

Otto started to review plugins too, and later Mika Epstein ([ipstenu](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ipstenu)) and Pippin Williamson ([morduak](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mordauk)) joined in 2012, when the plugin review team started to become a proper team in its own right. Later Boone Gorges ([boonebgorges](https://profiles.wordpress.org/boonebgorges/)) and Scott Riley ([coffee2code](http://profiles.wordpress.org/coffee2code)) joined the team. 

The plugin review team faces its own challenges -- different from those the theme review team faces. A theme is a specific group of template files with a defined structure. It calls functions, it requires a header, footer, and a sidebar. But a plugin can be anything at all, so thereâ€™s no way to automate the review process. It's a lot of work. Yet the benefit of introducing this review process is that it has cleared out malicious plugins, spam plugins, and plugins with security holes. A set of [guidelines has evolved](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/) to protect WordPress users. 

Again, a small group of contributors created a team that addressed a specific need within the project. This has continued ever since the summit, including teams that formed to develop training programs for people who want to teach WordPress, moderators for WordPress.tv, and contributors who help to support meetups. The summit provided an opportunity for people to get together, to talk about their own interests, meet like-minded contributors and move projects forward. It was also a time for the community to be together as a community, to get to know one another socially, instead of just through the text medium that dominates communication online.
